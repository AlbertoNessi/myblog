## Who I am
I'm Alberto Nessi and I'm a web developer based near Milan. Here to share just what I'm doing now, what I'm reading, watching and some interesting quotes.

## What I'm Doing Now - (https://www.albertonessi.it/now)
Working at Sec Group Srl building B2B web applications. Studying Python and Django in the free time. Looking and experimenting with LLMs too.


## Quotes - (https://www.albertonessi.it/quotes)
Showing all the interesting quotes I'm reading or listening in the internet. For example:

	From: Tobi Lutke's (Shopify's CEO) post on x.com 

	Economic growth is literally everything. People fondly remember the times of high GDP growth and treat the ones with low growth as the dark ages. Growth means positive sum thinking becomes the optimal strategy and this is the bedrock of civic society. We must build more companies and export products to make Canada better. No other mechanism exists. The schools are obscuring this fact and media often distorts it. Kudos to the Globe for getting it right here. Nature is healing?
